# n-body simulation in Rust and C

Following along with Cliff Biffle's [learn Rust the dangerous way](http://cliffle.com/p/dangerust), 
we'll be converting an unsafe, heavilly-optimized n-body simulation from C ([from the The Computer Language Benchmarks Game ](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/performance/nbody.html)) to Rust.
